## [0.0.21] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- `pytorch-custom` optional-dependencies extra — a "bring your own wheels" PyTorch
  backend. `torch`/`torchvision` are declared as plain pins with **no** index or git
  source override, so a prebuilt/custom wheelhouse satisfies them directly:

      uv sync --extra pytorch-custom --find-links /path/to/wheels
      # or: export UV_FIND_LINKS=/path/to/wheels && uv sync --extra pytorch-custom

  Ideal for platforms without upstream binaries (e.g. riscv64) or your own optimized
  torch build — zero source builds, and no per-package `--no-install-package` /
  force-reinstall dance. Mutually exclusive with `pytorch-cpu` / `pytorch-cu130` /
  `pytorch-rocm71` (wired into `[tool.uv] conflicts`).

### Changed
- Scoped the resolved lock to the environments whose PyTorch is resolvable from
  public indexes via `[tool.uv] environments` (linux non-riscv64, macOS, Windows).
  riscv64 has no upstream torch wheels, so it now resolves fresh at `uv sync` time
  and picks the custom wheels up from `--find-links`; `uv sync --frozen` falls back
  to a live resolve automatically.
- Regenerated `uv.lock` (resolves 262 packages; verified consistent with
  `uv lock --check`).

## [0.0.20] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Container/runtime-oriented ML dependency extras `ml-ai-webgpu`, `ml-ai-nvidia`,
  and `ml-ai-rocm`, mirroring the ONNX Runtime / PyTorch backend combinations that
  Kataglyphis-ContainerHub previously patched into `pyproject.toml` at install
  time. Selecting a backend is now a first-class extra rather than an install-time
  patch.

### Changed
- Regenerated `uv.lock` for the new extras (resolves 261 packages; verified
  consistent with `uv lock --locked`).
